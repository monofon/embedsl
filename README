Embedsl is a Javascript library for the specification of GLSL shader programs in WebGL applications. The programmer uses a builder API to construct a set of expression trees that describe the shader program. This intermediate representation is then transformed into GLSL source code. 

Embedsl needs the Closure Library. Install the library directly into the embedsl directory.
