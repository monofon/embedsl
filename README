Embedsl is a Javascript library for the specification of GLSL shader programs
in WebGL applications. The programmer uses a builder API to construct a set of
expression trees that describe the shader program. This intermediate
representation is then transformed into GLSL source code. 

Embedsl needs the Closure Library. Install the library directly into the
embedsl directory.
